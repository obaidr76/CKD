                    <p>
                        By Stage 4 kidney disease, it becomes more common to have symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Swelling in the hands and feet </li>
                        <li>Back pain</li>
                        <li>Urinating more or less than normal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> To keep kidney disease from getting worse at this stage, there are steps that must be taken: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Have regular appointments with a nephrologist, to make a treatment plan that is best for you. Your nephrologist will tell you how often you will need to have your kidneys checked.
                        </li>
                        <li>Meet with a dietitian, who will help you follow a diet that will keep you healthy. </li>
                        <li>
                            If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, ask your doctor about special kinds of blood pressure medicines called ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Sometimes these medicines can help keep kidney disease from getting worse.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        this is the time to start talking with your nephrologist about how to prepare for kidney failure. Once your kidneys have failed, you will need to start dialysis or have a kidney transplant to live. You can start planning for dialysis or kidney transplant before you reach kidney failure.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Preparing for dialysis:</strong> There are several things you should consider when getting ready for dialysis. You will need to choose a type of dialysis, your vascular access type, and consider your finances and employment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Preparing for transplant:</strong> If you are able to find a living kidney donor, you may not need to start dialysis at all. It is possible to have a transplant when your kidneys are getting close to failure. There are many things to consider as you prepare for transplant.

                    <p>
                        Stage 5 kidney disease has severe symptoms because the kidneys have usually stopped working. If your kidneys fail, toxins and wastes build up in your blood which makes you very sick.
